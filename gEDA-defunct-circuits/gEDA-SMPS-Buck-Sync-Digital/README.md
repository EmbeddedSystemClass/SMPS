SMPS Basic Buck Circuit
-----------------------

This is a synchronous buck DC-DC converter using an ATMega48 microcontroller.
The circuit is intended for experimental use for investigation of SMPS
converters that use relatively low frequencies and single inductor
architectures.

The AVR microcontrollers are unlikely to have adequate response to be able to
respond to load or voltage changes, nevertheless they are well suited to
prototyping and experimentation.
