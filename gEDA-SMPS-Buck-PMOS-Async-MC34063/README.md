SMPS Asynchronous Buck Circuit with PMOS Switch
-----------------------------------------------

This project provides a basic asynchronous low power buck DC-DC converter using
a common switch mode IC MC34063 boosted by a single P-MOSFET switch driven by a
low frequency totem pole BJT driver.

The design uses a discrete driver circuit and through hole components to make
experimentation easier. The MOSFET uses the TO252 package. Modern P-MOSFETs 
such as the SQD50P04 are reasonably priced, readily available and have very low
on-resistance. The PCB has been designed to carry moderate currents of 5A-10A
which could be enhanced by use of thicker traces.
