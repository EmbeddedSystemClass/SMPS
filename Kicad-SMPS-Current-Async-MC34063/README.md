SMPS LED Driver
---------------

This project provides a small LED driver circuit using a common switch mode
IC MC34063 in a constant current configuration. The circuit is designed to
deliver up to 1.5A, the maximum current of the MC34063.

An extra resistor is provided that will allow adaptation of the circuit as a
buck converter. This resistor must be omitted for the constant current
application.
