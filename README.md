Switch Mode Power Supplies
--------------------------

This project aims to produce a number of SMPS circuits that use only a single
inductor. As such they cannot be isolating, and are oriented to simple dc-dc
conversions with a single output voltage or current. Low power circuits do
not require current boost. Circuits of slightly higher powers use MOSFET
current boost circuits. Switching frequencies are kept low to simplify PCB
design, at the expense of high EMI. Input voltages are constrained to less
than 30V for use in low voltage solar powered installations.
