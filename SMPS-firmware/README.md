SMPS Firmware for ARM
---------------------

This is STM32F102 firmware used during the development of an SMPS full-H
buck-boost system for experimental purposes. The development platform is the
ET-STM32F103 board from Futurlec.

The initial code is for a simple non-synchronous buck supply with PMOS high
switching.
