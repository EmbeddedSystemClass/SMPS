SMPS Lead Acid Battery Charger
------------------------------

This project aims to provide a PCB for a small capacity battery charger for
lead acid batteries. The context is to build a unit that will provide off-line
12V power to an external device while it is powered on, and charge the battery
when the device is turned off or when the battery capacity becomes critically
low.

The battery charger itself is to be used in other projects and as such is
brought out as an independent circuit.
